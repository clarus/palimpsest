# palimpsest â€” Fast serializable C++ dictionaries

_palimpsest_ is a C++ header-only library that exposes a single ``Dictionary`` type meant for fast value updates, with an API similar to Python's ``dict``. It is called [palimpsest](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palimpsest) because these dictionaries are optimized for frequent rewritings (values change all the time) on the same support (keys change once in a while).

## Install

### Header-only version

TODO(scaron): Copy the [include folder](include/palimpsest) to your build tree and use a C++11 compiler.

### Static library with Bazel (faster compile times)

Create a git repository rule for palimpsest, for instance:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

def palimpsest_repository():
    git_repository(
        name = "palimpsest",
        remote = "git@github.com:stephane-caron/palimpsest.git",
        commit = "...",
        shallow_since = "..."
    )
```

Then call this rule from the ``WORKSPACE`` file at the root of your Bazel repository.
