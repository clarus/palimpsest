# palimpsest â€” Fast serializable C++ dictionaries

_palimpsest_ is a C++ header-only library that exposes a single ``Dictionary`` type meant for fast value updates, with an API similar to Python's ``dict``. It is called [palimpsest](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palimpsest) because these dictionaries are optimized for frequent rewritings (values change all the time) on the same support (keys change once in a while).
