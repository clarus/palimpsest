# palimpsest â€” Fast serializable C++ dictionaries

[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/stephane-caron/palimpsest/CI)](https://github.com/stephane-caron/palimpsest/actions)
![C++ version](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17/20-blue.svg?style=flat)

_palimpsest_ is a C++ header-only library that exposes a single ``Dictionary`` type meant for fast value updates, with an API similar to Python's ``dict``. It is called [palimpsest](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palimpsest) because these dictionaries are optimized for frequent rewritings (values change all the time) on the same support (keys change once in a while).

## Features and non-features

All design decisions have their pros and cons. _palimpsest_ was designed for inter-process communication between real-time control programs, so it lies somewhere specific on the spectrum. Check the features and caveats below to see if it is a fit for _your_ use case.

### Features

<details>
<summary>Direct references to sub-dictionaries or values</summary>

```c++
Dictionary dict;
Dictionary& foo = dict("foo");
foo("bar") = 42;
const int& bar = dict("foo")("bar");
foo("bar") /= 7;
assert(bar == 6);
```
</details>

* Built-in support for [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* Print to standard output as JSON
* Serialize to and deserialize from JSON
* Serialize to and deserialize from [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/)

### Non-features

<details>
<summary>Array values are limited to matrices and vectors</summary>

This means arrays of "things" are not allowed, only arrays of numbers. For instance,

```json
{"foo": [1.0, 2.0]}
```

can be handled and its value will be deserialized as an ``Eigen::Vector2d``. However,

```json
{"foo": ["string", {"bar": 42}]}  # not OK
```

cannot be handled, as the array cannot be deserialized to an Eigen type.
</details>

* Copy constructors are disabled

## Install

### Header-only version

TODO(scaron): Copy the [include folder](include/palimpsest) to your build tree and use a C++11 compiler.

### Static library with Bazel (faster compile times)

Create a git repository rule for palimpsest, for instance:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

def palimpsest_repository():
    git_repository(
        name = "palimpsest",
        remote = "git@github.com:stephane-caron/palimpsest.git",
        commit = "...",
        shallow_since = "..."
    )
```

Then call this rule from the ``WORKSPACE`` file at the root of your Bazel repository, and use the ``@palimpsest`` dependency:

```python
cc_binary(
    name = "my_dictionary_loving_program",
    srcs = ["MyDictionaryLovingProgram.cpp"],
    deps = [
        "@palimpsest",
    ],
)
```

### Usage

```c++
#include <palimpsest/Dictionary.h>

using palimpsest::Dictionary;
```
